  # Configuration for your Next.js project using Bun's lockfile/packages
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    # Look for package.json and lock files in the root directory
    directory: "/"
    # Check for updates daily, weekly, etc.
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    # *** THIS IS THE KEY SETTING ***
    # Raise pull requests for version updates against the 'dev' branch
    target-branch: "dev"
    # Optional: Enable Bun support (may not be strictly necessary as 'npm' often works,
    # but good practice for modern node ecosystems if available)
    # The 'npm' ecosystem in Dependabot is often used for Node-based projects,
    # and it typically works with bun's package.json/bun.lockb.
    # If Dependabot officially supports a 'bun' ecosystem, you'd use that instead,
    # but 'npm' is the standard fallback for many Node-based projects.

    # Optional: Add a label to easily identify Dependabot PRs
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "dependabot"
